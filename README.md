 for pokemon battles - we need to change map first, just letting the person go to places that are near him, by walking 2 to 3 times, and by acepting a starter and starting him in the first map area, after that you will have a change of getting pokemon encounters by walking, and catching pokemon that are in an area when you enter it (you entered an area and there is a [][][] do you want to catch any?), (algo getting items when catching pokemons and walking, catching pokemons after a fight helps with odds.)
  

  change map to locations and let explore enter the exact area, when entering an area you level up and have a random encounter, you fight catch it level up more,get the pokemon, get more pokeballs and assign it directly if space left in party, then you have the walk command where there is a 50/50 chance of another encounter, you can move areas and thats it.
